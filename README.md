**Bricker**

A puzzle game where the goal is to knock down all the bricks by deflecting balls.

**Background**

This game was created by Noy Davidi as a project for the Object-Oriented Programming course at Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
I enjoyed working on this project and found it to be a challenging and rewarding experience.
I learned a lot about object-oriented programming, game development, and software engineering.

**Gameplay**

The player controls a paddle that can be moved left and right. The goal is to deflect a ball so that it hits the bricks.
When a brick is hit, it will disappear. The player has a limited number of lives. If the ball falls below the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life.
If the player loses all of their lives, the game is over.

**Controls**

Move the paddle: Left and Right in keyboard

Features

The game features a variety of bricks, each with its own unique properties. Some bricks can be destroyed by a single hit, while others require multiple hits.
There are also power-ups that can be collected to help the player, such as a ball that bounces off walls or a paddle that becomes larger.

**What I Learned**

I learned a lot about object-oriented programming while working on this project.
I learned how to create classes, objects, and methods. I also learned how to use inheritance and polymorphism.
I also learned about game development and software engineering. I learned how to design games and how to implement them using object-oriented programming principles.
